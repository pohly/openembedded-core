yocto-compat-layer: bitbake-diffsigs support + per machine checks + OE-core fixes

Manually calling bitbake-diffsigs is cumbersome and doesn't work in a CI
environment, so now the test itself does it for test_signatures.

Regarding the BSP example that I ended up using: it actually was one
of the better BSP layers and only had one problem in a "bitbake world"
build instead of several as in other BSP layers.

All pre-requisites in bitbake and OE-core are merged and no further
work is planned, so this patch series could be merged now after
reviewing the changes.

The OE-core fixes are included here because they were developed in
parallel to enhancing the tool which found them. They probably should
be merged sooner.

V2: - use self.fail() instead of self.assertTrue(False, ...)
    - test_machine_signatures check (work in progress)
V3: - rebased onto master where some yocto-compat-layer enhancements were already merged
    - added OE-core fixes for issues found by the per-machine signature comparison
    - finished test_machine_signatures (shorter output, explanations
      on how to run bitbake-diffsigs, end report with one bitbake-diffsigs invocation)
    - allow "bitbake -S none world" to fail during test_machine_signatures,
      report such failures in a separate test_machine_world
