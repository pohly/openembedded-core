oeqa: more control over qemu

I'm currently working on testing an installer image. During that test
I need to:
- boot with two drives attached to the virtual machine (installer image
  and internal disk)
- install to internal disk
- reboot with just the internal disk

There were several problems doing that:
- attaching second disk via qemuparams was not possible
- run_serial() timed out too early during the long-running install command
- writes to the internal disks were discarded
- booting with only the non-standard internal disk instead of the
  recipe's image was not possible

This patch series probably conflicts with the patches that Robert posted.
If those are meant to go in first, then I'll post a rebased V2.
