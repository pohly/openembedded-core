Yocto Compatible 2.0 support code

As discussed in the "[Openembedded-architecture] Yocto Compatible 2.0
+ signature changes" mail thread, changes in a .bbappend cannot be
done unconditionally. Making _append and _remove depend on overrides
which get set based on DISTRO_FEATURES is one way of achieving this.

Conditional includes can have unexpected results when used with checks
that still change during parsing. Helper functions might make this a bit
safer and easier to review by limiting the check to DISTRO_FEATURES.

Changes in V2:
  - added df- prefix to distro feature overrides
  - replaced too complex optional_includes() with simpler
    all/any_distro_features()
