yocto-compat-layer: per machine checks

It is important to test with real MACHINE values, otherwise changes
introduced by layers only when their machines are selected wouldn't
show up. The new test_machine_signatures and test_machine_world tests
cover two aspects of that (signature differences and world build
failures).

V2: - use self.fail() instead of self.assertTrue(False, ...)
    - test_machine_signatures check (work in progress)
V3: - rebased onto master where some yocto-compat-layer enhancements were already merged
    - added OE-core fixes for issues found by the per-machine signature comparison
    - finished test_machine_signatures (shorter output, explanations
      on how to run bitbake-diffsigs, end report with one bitbake-diffsigs invocation)
    - allow "bitbake -S none world" to fail during test_machine_signatures,
      report such failures in a separate test_machine_world
V4: - avoid DEPENDS_remove for go-cross
    - commit message spelling fixes
V5: - rebased after preceeding patches were merged
    - generate task list dynamically based on depgraph instead of hard-coding it
