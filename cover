Yocto Compatible 2.0 support code

As discussed in the "[Openembedded-architecture] Yocto Compatible 2.0
+ signature changes" mail thread, changes in a .bbappend cannot be
done unconditionally. Making _append and _remove depend on overrides
which get set based on DISTRO_FEATURES is one way of achieving this.

The oe.utils.optional_includes() helper function has not been
discussed before. It's an attempt to address concerns by developers
that having to write code for (potentially complex) condition checking
is error prone and hard to read.

It depends on the bitbake enhancement that allows including multiple
files at once.
