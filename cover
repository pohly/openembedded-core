yocto-compat-layer.py: various enhancements

While enhancing the layer structure in intel-iot-refkit I ran into
various cases where enhancements to the tool were
necessary. intel-iot-refkit now has oe-selftests that check all layers
using this tool. In addition, the signature checking utility code is
imported into a custom test that also covers a refkit specific case
(including refkit-config.inc must not change signatures).

Changes in V2:
- turn signature checking in software layers on/off via command line flags
