UEFI + Secure Boot + qemu

There seems to be a consensus that supporting UEFI in OE-core for qemu
would be valuable, and there have been some (stalled) attempts to add
it. For reference, see:
   [OE-core] [PATCH V3 0/3] Add UEFI firmware for qemux86*
   [OE-core] Add ovmf-native to make qemu-native/runqemu support boot UEFI image?
   https://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5654
   https://github.com/01org/luv-yocto/issues/38

This patch set includes the necessary recipes (ovmf from meta-luv, acpica from
meta-oe), some improvements to them (in particular, enabling Secure
Boot), and changes to runqemu to make it easier to boot with UEFI. A
special image recipes builds an image which can be used to lock down a
virtual machine by enrolling the "normal" pre-installed certificates.

In contrast to the first version of this patch series, one can now use
both a single OVMF firmware file as well as set up persistent
variables for a virtual machine by using two files.

Eduardo promised to add automated testing for this once it is in OE-core.
As it stands now, ovmf-shell-image and ovmf without Secure Boot enabled
should at least be part of a world build.

As discussed on this list, Ricardo and Fathi volunteered to help with
maintaining the ovmf and acpica recipes in OE-core.

Beware that "git am --keep-cr" must be used to import the ovmf patches
correctly.

Changes since V1:
- support both combined code+vars ("ovmf") and separate code
  and vars flash drives ("ovmf.code ovmf.vars")
- OVMF firmware no longer installed in the target sysroot
- slightly simpler renaming from OVMF (uppercase, underscore)
  to OE naming convention (lowercase, dots): now the different
  ln invocation directly create files with the final name
- DEPLOYDIR needs to be cleaned explicitly (done via cleandirs varflag)
- Secure Boot support in ovmf is controlled by a PACKAGECONFIG option,
  off by default
- distros and developers can add additional Secure Boot compile flags
  with OVMF_SECURE_BOOT_EXTRA_FLAGS
- explain how to get ovmf built for use with runqemu via MACHINE_ESSENTIAL_EXTRA_RDEPENDS
- IMAGE_FSTYPES_forcevariable = "wic" used in ovmf-shell-image
- remove OVMF BGRT patch
- location of "inherit deploy"
