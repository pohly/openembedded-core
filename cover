bblayers sanity: bblayers.conf.sample specific update code

In an experimental branch of refkit I bumped LCONF_VERSION from 4 to 5
and ran into the problem mentioned in the commit message: instead of
raising an error as before, the code (incorrectly) claimed to have
updated the bblayers.conf file.

Perhaps refkit should have started with LCONF_VERSION as in the
current OE-core bblayers.conf.sample file to avoid being affected by
this - too late for that now, though.

As an ugly workaround I'm currently jumping from 4 to 8 directly,
which produces some extra (and wrong) output about "automatically
updated" before finally raising the expected error (twice, for some
reasons).

I'm not sure how this code was meant to work for different distros
based on OE-core. Depending on when a distro forked from OE-core and
how it continued with numbering its bblayers.conf.sample file, there
must have been such conflicts already before.

Note that I have only checked that the code gets called when placed in
the expected location, and the code itself was copied verbatim. As it
refers to ancient changes, I've not actually tried to set up a build
dir where that upgrade path is necessary. Perhaps the code could even
be removed entirely?
