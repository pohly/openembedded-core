development vs. production builds

The previous revision of this patch series showed what could be done
at a distro level and image level. It was not suitable for OE-core
because it encoded too specific use-cases and the usefulness of a
distro-level switch is questionable.

The image-level mode switching however seems useful. This revision
focuses on just that aspect. Instead of pre-defining certain modes and
their meaning, only the generic infrastructure is left.

It's still a separate class for reasons given in the commit
message. That could be changed.

Changes in V2:
- dropped "build-mode" DISTRO_FEATURES
- moved "development/debug/production" modes from actual code into
